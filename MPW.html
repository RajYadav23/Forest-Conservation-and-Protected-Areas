<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Protected areas are increasingly promoted for their capacity to sequester carbon, alongside biodiversity benefits. However, we have limited understanding of whether they are effective at reducing deforestation and degradation, or promoting vegetation growth, and the impact that this has on changes to aboveground woody carbon stocks. Here we present a new satellite radar-based map of vegetation carbon change across southern Africa’s woodlands and combine this with a matching approach to assess the effect of protected areas on carbon dynamics. We show that protection has a positive effect on aboveground carbon, with stocks increasing faster in protected areas (+0.53% per year) compared to comparable lands not under protection (+0.08% per year). The positive effect of protection reflects lower rates of deforestation (−39%) and degradation (−25%), as well as a greater prevalence of vegetation growth (+12%) inside protected lands. Areas under strict protection had similar outcomes to other types of protection after controlling for differences in location, with effect scores instead varying more by country, and the level of threat. These results highlight the potential for protected areas to sequester aboveground carbon, although we caution that in some areas this may have negative impacts on biodiversity, and human wellbeing.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Protected areas, and other area-based conservation measures, remain a flagship strategy for reducing carbon emissions and biodiversity losses due to land use and land cover change1,2. Their importance was reflected in the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (2011–2020), and in Target 3 of the recently agreed Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework that sets out an ambition for 30% coverage of protected and conserved areas by 20303. However, questions remain over the extent to which protected areas (hereafter PAs) are effective at meeting their multiple aims4, leading to calls for evidence-based assessments of the performance of existing protected and conserved areas, to inform future expansion efforts1.</p>
<p>Evidence regarding the effectiveness of PAs in delivering positive outcomes for nature and climate has increased rapidly over the past decade5,6,7,8,9, although progress has been limited by our ability to accurately map changes in habitat structure across large areas. Indeed, whilst much work has focused on the ability of PAs to reduce deforestation, it has been harder to quantify if they can mitigate habitat degradation. These subtle changes in vegetation structure, which are typically caused by processes including overharvesting, inappropriate fire regimes, and other changes in land management, and can be important in driving carbon emissions10,11,12,13, and lead to major changes in biodiversity14,15. There is similar lack of knowledge over the extent to which aboveground woody carbon (AGC) storage may be increasing via vegetation growth16 and whether PAs have a role in mediating these patterns, e.g. by altering activities that suppress growth such as fire and herbivory. This information is particularly important with many countries likely to use PAs way of meeting international climate obligations. This may involve reducing carbon emissions from land use change, e.g. as part of Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, as well as maintaining areas of vegetation growth in existing wooded areas, or enhancing growth through active restoration efforts e.g. as part of the Bonn Challenge17.</p>
<p>The absence of such data on PA effectiveness reflects the considerable methodological and practical difficulties in measuring aboveground carbon storage, and especially its changes over time18. Studies reporting the impacts of PAs on deforestation, and degradation7 have done so using optical satellite data, which used in isolation, is limited to measurements of the visible (2D) surface, and so provide no information on the vertical structure of the vegetation, and thus limited insights into its carbon density. Smaller changes in AGC, such as those related to vegetation growth, and lower intensity degradation, are therefore particularly difficult to measure using satellite remote sensing data, as they typically result in no clear changes to the tree canopy/ spectral signature (i.e. greenness) of the surface meaning optical measurements can miss a large proportion of these events10,19.</p>

<p>The southern African woodlands are an important study region for evaluating PA impacts given their high biodiversity value, including many charismatic, but threatened animal and plant species which are endemic to the region30. African woodlands are unusual in that they retain significant wooded area and carbon stocks, alongside a large human population closely dependant on ecosystems for food, fuel, timber, and construction materials31,32. Increasing demand for resources is leading to widespread, and rapid deforestation and degradation, particularly around rapidly expanding urban centres and road networks10,33,34,35, with regrowth in more remote areas thought to be counteracting these losses10. The time period covered by our dataset means PAs established after 2014 were excluded from the analysis, at which point they covered 21% of the region (7–35% of each country’s land mass area; Fig. 1), with this large extent meaning they likely play a critical role in mediating carbon dynamics and patterns of human disturbance.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Carbon and land-cover dynamics</h3>
<p>Region-wide AGC stocks were likely constant over the study period, estimated at 6.1 [95% CI: 5.4–6.7] Pg C in 2007–2010, and 6.2 [5.5–6.8] Pg C in the period 2015–2018 (Fig. 1), with net losses in Mozambique and Tanzania offset by net gains in the other countries (Fig. 2). The small net change in AGC (ΔAGC) obscures large gross losses from deforestation (0.2 [0.17–0.23] Pg C) and degradation (0.2 [0.17–0.23] Pg C), and gross gains from vegetation growth (0.6 [0.52–0.68] Pg C) (see ‘Methods’ for a definition of these land cover changes). The total wooded area, defined here as any 25 m pixel with an initial AGC density >10 Mg C ha−1, was 2.6 [2.4–2.8] M km2, with carbon gains detected in 55% [47– 61%] of this area, and deforestation and degradation occurring in 7.2% [6.0–9.1%] and 8.4% [7.0–10.0%] of the wooded area, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 1). The remainder of the wooded area (29.1% [23.5–36.0%]) experienced minor losses of AGC (<20%), which are likely caused by quasi-natural processes e.g. fire, herbivory36.</p>

<p>PAs contain 21%, and 18% of the total wooded area and AGC stocks, respectively, although their importance varies by country, with PAs in Malawi and Tanzania containing a disproportionate amount of the national AGC stocks, relative to their areal extent (Fig. 1). PAs are not exempt from anthropogenic disturbance, with 21,000 [19– 25,000] km2, or 4.1% [3.4–5.2%] of the PA being deforested, and a further 31,000 [28–42,000] km2, or 6.2% [5.2–7.9%] undergoing a major loss (i.e. degradation) of AGC stocks (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2). Smaller PAs appear more susceptible to these losses with 65% of PAs <100 km2 in size exhibiting higher deforestation and/ or degradation rates than the region-wide rates reported above, compared to 32% of PAs >1000 km2 (Fig. 2). Carbon gains were more prevalent inside PAs than outside, with 60% [52–66%] of protected wooded areas increasing in AGC. This, combined with lower deforestation and degradation rates, mean PAs make an outsized contribution to the overall carbon balance, with AGC stocks increasing at faster rate (+0.62% yr−1 [0.52–0.71 % yr−1]; total increase 0.54 Pg C ≡ 54 Million Tonnes (Tg) [49–60 Tg]) compared to unprotected areas (+0.12% yr−1 [0.07–0.18% yr−1]; 48 [30–67] Tg C).</p>

  <h3>The PA effect on carbon stock change</h3>
  <p>The differences in carbon and land use dynamics between protected and unprotected areas described above reflect, in part, a location bias, with PAs tending to be located in relatively inaccessible parts of the study region where anthropogenic disturbances are less likely (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). After matching, we find PAs have an overall positive effect on aboveground woody carbon (AGC), with stocks increasing by +0.53% yr−1 [0.43–0.62% yr−1] (2.79 [2.19–3.54] Tg C yr−1) inside matched PAs, compared to +0.08% yr−1 [−0.05–0.21% yr−1] (0.40 [−0.23–1.12] Tg C yr−1) in the matched unprotected sample (Fig. 3). The small difference to the region-wide results presented in the previous section reflects the exclusion of the more remote and inaccessible parts of the PA network (45% of total protected wooded area) for which there are no suitable counterfactual areas to compare against (Supplementary Fig. 1). This is an important feature of our approach whereby PAs with no high quality matches are excluded since it is generally better to obtain an estimate of effectiveness with limited bias.</p>

<p>Overall, the carbon benefits of protection primarily reflects a reduction in carbon losses from deforestation, which were 42% lower in PAs compared to matched controls (1.26 [0.99–1.42] vs 2.15 [1.70–2.43] Tg C yr−1, meaning that avoided deforestation accounts for 40% of the overall effect of PAs on ΔAGC (Figs. 3 and 4). We find PAs have a smaller but important effect on carbon losses via degradation (31% lower: 1.41 [1.17–1.60] vs 2.1 [1.71-2.33] Tg C yr−1), and on carbon sequestered via vegetation growth (10% higher: 6.86 [5.74–7.85] vs. 6.15 [5.14–7.03] Tg C yr−1), both of which contribute 28% to the net PA effect on ΔAGC, with the residual 4% due to a small reduction in minor losses. The biomass growth rate in areas that increased in AGC is similar in matched protected and unprotected areas averaging +0.55 ± 0.2 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 (mean ± SD), as is the intensity of both deforestation (−13.2 ± 6.0 Mg C ha−1), and degradation (−8.0 ± 2.7 Mg C ha−1), which may indicate similar types of agriculture and harvesting activities under protection. As such, the positive carbon outcomes in PAs largely reflects proportionate reductions in the areal extent of deforestation (−38% lower in matched PAs), degradation (−25%), and increases in the area of vegetation growth (+12%) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Our results are in keeping with previous assessments of avoided deforestation6,37, and to the best of knowledge, directly show for the first time that avoided degradation, and increased vegetation growth are important carbon benefits of protection.</p>

<p>The overall trends of PAs reducing land cover change, and increasing AGC stocks relative to their matched counterparts is consistent across countries (Figs. 3 and 4). However, there are large differences in the effect size of protection between national PA networks, with those in Tanzania, Malawi, and to a lesser extent Angola having the greatest matched effect on ΔAGC (Fig. 3). In contrast, the comparatively rapid gains in AGC observed across PAs in Katanga-DRC, and to some degree Zambia and Zimbabwe, are nearly equalled by gains in matched unprotected lands, meaning their PA networks are assessed as less effective at enhancing ΔAGC (Fig. 3) compared to unprotected areas.</p>
<h3>Variation in the effectiveness of PAs on carbon outcomes</h3>
<p>
  The broad national-level trends (Figs. 3 and 4) provide insights into the role PAs play in overall carbon balance, and their potential to contribute to national-level efforts to reduce carbon losses from deforestation and degradation. These results are naturally weighted towards larger, better matched PAs, and obscure the considerable within-country differences in effect scores related to PA designation (i.e. National Parks, Forest Reserves etc.), and heterogeneity between individual PAs (Supplementary Figs. 3–5 and Supplementary Data 3). Understanding the impact PA designation has on effect scores is particularly important given plans to expand the network and the financial commitment, and potential social costs (e.g. restricted access to resources) associated with creating new PAs.</p>
<p>To that end, we compare carbon outcomes in areas likely to be under strict protection (36% of the total area protected; largely IUCN categories I–II, and National Parks), from those which are not, with these split if they are designated as Forest Reserves (21% of area), or managed principally as Wildlife Reserves (43%). The results show that overall, each of these groupings results in positive outcomes on ΔAGC, with the overall difference compared to matched unprotected areas estimated at +0.45% yr−1 for strict protection, +0.60% yr−1 for forest reserves, and +0.33% yr−1 for wildlife reserves, although the pattern, and size of the effect varies somewhat by country (Supplementary Fig. 4). As with protected and unprotected areas, direct comparisons between PA types are confounded by biases in location; for example, a large number of forest reserves tend to be located in areas with high land use intensity (Fig. 2), thus providing a greater opportunity for these PAs to have a larger effect. To account for this, we calculated standardised estimates of the PA effect on ΔAGC, and the gross carbon losses from deforestation and degradation (Fig. 5) using a Bayesian regression procedure which accounts for observable differences related to accessibility, extractable value and potential agricultural suitability, as well as country and management status (see ‘Methods’).</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We find PAs are, on average, associated with increases of aboveground woody carbon (AGC), above that in matched unprotected areas. This is the result of avoided deforestation and degradation and associated carbon losses, and also an increase in the areal extent of vegetation growth, relative to non-PAs. These three processes contribute 39%, 28% and 28% of the net carbon benefits of protection, respectively. The relatively even split across the three key land cover processes is important as it highlights that previous analyses which solely analysed deforestation effects are missing many of the carbon benefits of PAs39. Our results also reaffirm known patterns of AGC change across our study region10, with carbon losses concentrated around urban centres and road networks, and carbon gains in more remote areas with sparse population, and/or a relatively high (>1000 mm yr−1) mean annual precipitation (e.g. northern Angola, western Zambia, southern DRC).</p>
<p>Here, we show that PAs also play an important role in shaping these patterns, which for the first time is shown to include the prevalence of vegetation growth, which is 12% higher compared to matched unprotected areas, albeit with no differences in the rate at which carbon is accumulating (0.55 Mg C ha yr−1). These carbon gains encompass both the growth of mature vegetation and wooded areas re-growing following disturbance, but do not include growth in non-wooded areas (<10 Mg C ha−1), or non-wooded to wooded transitions, due to additional uncertainties on change detection in low AGC areas. Whilst these carbon benefits may help address the climate change mitigation agenda, it is important to acknowledge that increasing woody biomass in more open ecosystems can be associated with a loss of biodiversity40, and in parts of our study region, may directly conflict with biodiversity management goals. There is likely a dichotomy between the wetter regions of the study (the Miombo woodlands) where increasing woody cover is rarely perceived as a biodiversity threat, and associated with higher faunal and floral diversity41,42, and the more open arid ecosystems where it is a key concern of land managers43. As a result, the finding of more extensive woody AGC increases in PAs might result in a mixed picture for biodiversity conservation in some parts of the region.</p>
<p>Degradation, which in this carbon-focused context refers to a reduction in the carbon density of the vegetation, without a transition to very low woody biomass often associated with a new land cover (i.e. deforestation), has previously been shown to be a major source of carbon loss from these ecosystems10,44. In this study, we find that degradation accounted for 49% of the combined anthropogenic (i.e. deforestation and degradation) carbon losses, confirming its importance as a major source of land use change emissions, albeit one not easily accounted for in the global carbon budget45. We anticipated that PAs would be less effective at reducing degradation compared to deforestation, as the transient activities that lead to the degradation of AGC, such harvesting for timber and charcoal34, would be harder to reduce in PAs than the more sedentary activities that cause deforestation, which is often driven by agricultural expansion36. People travel large distances to collect potentially valuable resources, with PAs potentially containing more tree species of harvestable size for timber and charcoal due to historically lower rates of disturbance, meaning even inaccessible areas may be targeted for timber extraction12,46,47. Our findings support this hypothesis, with matched PAs showing a smaller reduction in degradation rates (−25%) and associated carbon emissions (−31%), compared to deforestation (−38% and −41% respectively).</p>
<p>This general pattern is broadly consistent, although it obscures considerable heterogeneity in effect scores between countries (Figs. 2 and 3), and among individual PAs (Supplementary Fig. 5). At the national-level, our results show there is relatively little difference between countries in terms of the deforestation and degradations rates inside PAs. Instead, the variations in effect scores largely reflects the varying pressures PAs are under, specifically, the rate of loss in matched unprotected areas, and whether they are located in areas suitable for growing cash crops, and/or in close proximity to major cities.</p>
<p>Each of our broad PA designations were associated with positive outcomes on carbon storage, although we find no evidence that this has a meaningful impact on effect scores, once biases in location are accounted for. Indeed, those PAs more likely to place greater restrictions on land use, i.e. those with IUCN management category I-II, and/or National Parks, result in similar outcomes to PAs less likely to limit human use, and/or receive less support than more prominent conservation areas48. Tanzania is a notable exception, with forest reserves and wildlife areas outperforming strictly PAs. The reasons for this are unclear, especially the outsized impact of forest reserves, which likely receive less funding that strictly PAs48. The comparatively large impact of wildlife reserves may reflect, in part, the positive influence of Selous Game Reserve, which constitutes 17% of the Tanzanian dataset. It is designated at IUCN category IV area and so not considered strictly protected, although it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and since 2019, part of it has been reclassified as a National Park.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Mapping carbon and land use change</h3>
<p>
  The datasets were broadly created using methods described in reference10, which presented maps of AGC densities and change for the period 2007–2010 at 25 m resolution, using a combination of satellite radar images, specifically the ALOS PALSAR mosaic product (Ver. 1), produced by the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA)27, and in situ carbon stock estimates for converting radar backscatter to estimates of AGC. Change detection is based on a probabilistic approach that takes into account uncertainties in the radar data itself, and the conversion of the radar backscatter to aboveground carbon densities. A full description of the underlying methods are detailed in reference10, however for clarity, we summarise the key aspects relevant to the current analysis, and detail all additions and modifications to the original method, which were largely to account for the inclusion of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data covering the period 2015–2018.</p>
