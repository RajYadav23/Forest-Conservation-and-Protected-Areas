  <h1>Introduction
  </h1>
  <p>Did you know that forests are called the lungs of the environment? They are a factory of oxygen and various other very important natural resources. Can humans live without their lungs? Similarly, the environment too would not survive without forests. Let us take a look at forest conservation.</p>
  
  <h2>Forest Conservation</h2>

 <p>Forest conservation as the name suggests is the preservation and the protection of forests. It also involves the reversal of deforestation and environmental pollution. The preservation of all natural resources is absolutely essential for the balance of our ecosystem.<br>
 
  <h3>Importance of Forests</h3>
 <p>Let us take a look at why forests are so very important to us and our environment. We are basically dependent on forests for our survival. And so their conservation is of essential importance.</p><br>
<p>   The most important function of forests is that it produces mass amounts of oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. Oxygen is the main respiratory gas for all animals, it ensures our survival.</p>

<P>   Forests also prevent soil erosion and keep soil pollution in check. Deforestation, in fact, leads to soil erosion on a large scale since the topsoil comes loose.</P>
<P>   Forests also play an important part in the water cycle and control moisture levels of our ecosystem.</P>
<p>   And finally, forests are the natural home and habitat for millions of species of animals, birds, and insects.</p>


<h2>Ways to Conserve the Forest</h2>
<h3>Controlled Deforestation</h3>
   <p>
    While deforestation cannot be avoided completely, we must look to control it. Young and immature trees should not be felled as far as possible. We must look to avoid large-scale commercial deforestation as well. Adapting practices such as clear-cutting or selective cutting will be beneficial in the long run.<p>

<h3>Protect against Forest Fires</h3>
<p>Forest fires are the most common and deadly cause of loss of forests. They can start due to natural causes or can be accidents caused by man or even intentional in some cases. Once a fire spreads in a forest it is very difficult to control. Precautions must be taken for such incidents. Making fire lanes, spreading chemicals to control fire, clearing out dry leaves and trees etc.</p>
<h3>Afforestation</h3>
<p>This is the process by which we plant more trees in the area. We try to increase the forest cover by manual transplantation, or fresh plantation of trees. It is an attempt to balance our ecosystem to reduce the effects of deforestation and environmental pollutions of all types.</p>

<h3>Better Farming Practices</h3>
<p>Slash and burn farming, overgrazing by cattle, shifting agriculture are all farming practices that are harmful to the environment and particularly to forests. We must keep all these practices under control.</p>
<p>Jhoom farming is one such practice we can employ to combat forest pollution. In the North-east areas of India, where the land is kept barren after cutting the crops. Weeds and creepers and wild plants grow on this land and make it fertile again in time. And then the land is cultivated again</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions – FAQs</h2>
  <h3>Q1
    What steps should be taken to conserve forests?</h3>
    <p>The forests can be conserved in the following manner:
      Introducing afforestation programs.
      Controlling forest fires.
      Proper utilization of forest resources.
      Proper care should be taken to protect the forests from pests and diseases.</p>

  <h3>Q2
    Why is it beneficial to conserve forests?</h3>
    <p>Forests provide us with a variety of resources such as wood, timber, fibre and other raw materials for domestic as well as commercial purposes. They absorb the harmful carbon dioxide gas and maintain the earth’s temperature. They also hold the soil firmly and prevent erosion of soil. This is why it is beneficial to conserve forests.</p>
  <h3>Q3
    How can we conserve wildlife?</h3>
    <p>Wildlife can be conserved by:
      Developing protective areas such as national parks, and wildlife sanctuaries to protect the animals in their natural habitat.
      The endangered and vulnerable species can be kept in captivity in places such as zoos and bred to increase their population.
      The cutting of forests should be strictly prohibited. It is an abode of a variety of wild animals.
      The hunting of wild animals should be banned.</p>
<h3>Q4
  What will happen if all the forests are destroyed?</h3>
  <p>Fossil fuels are a non-renewable source of energy. Most of the energy used by us is obtained by the burning of fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are used up at a faster rate. They cannot be regrown at a scale compared to their consumption.</p>
<h3>Q5
  What is Deforestation?</h3>
<p>Deforestation can be defined as the large-scale removal of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation of human activities. It is a serious environmental concern since it can result in the loss of biodiversity, damage to natural habitats.</p>
