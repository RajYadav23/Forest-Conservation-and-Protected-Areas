  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>Forest ecosystems are important habitats for a vast number of species worldwide. These ecosystems are degrading faster than they are regenerating, due to the increased demand for natural resources. In order to protect these ecosystems, the designation of Protected Areas (PAs) has become the primary policy tool for forest conservation. The articles included in this book explore challenges and opportunities within forest PAs, focusing on four main themes. The first theme is current initiatives in forest management across the world, reflecting the efforts of several organizations in halting deforestation. Major challenges are also identified, reflecting the declining rates of forest coverage across the world. A second theme refers to policy planning processes withing existing governance frameworks focusing, in particular, on the level of engagement of local stakeholders. A third theme of the book refers to social equity and how the impacts of forest PAs are distributed among different users. A final theme in the SI refers to potential solutions in order to halt the loss of biodiversity within forest ecosystems. Several directions are proposed by the authors that can be useful for policy makers and practitioners, especially in the context of the 30 by 30 targets.</p>

  <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
 <p>Protected and Conserved Areas (PCAs), including Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs), are one of the most effective tools for preventing loss of natural ecosystems and species, as well as to achieve long-term sustainable development, including Aichi targets 11 and 12 and several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In some regions, PCAs are the center of economic development, through tourism, sustainable use of resources and as sources of freshwater. PCAs also contribute to food security through maintenance of the ecosystem services that support agriculture, by protecting resources essential for crop breeding programmes, and by providing space for traditional biodiversity-friendly farming and grazing systems. PCAs also have a major role to play in climate resilience, both by storing and sequestering carbon, and by ensuring that ecosystems continue to provide goods and services to human societies. </p>
<p>PCAs currently cover a little over 15 per cent of Earth’s terrestrial surface, including inland waters, and 7.3 per cent of global oceans. However, over 50 million hectares of protected areas worldwide have lost legal protection since 1900 as a result of protected area downgrading, downsizing and degazettement (PADDD).</p>
<p>PCAs are a key element of WWF’s vision that 30 per cent of the Earth’s land, inland waters and sea are restored and protected.</p>

<h2>OUR WORK</h2>
<h3>Policy and advocacy at national and international levels</h3>
   <p>
    particularly working with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), World Heritage Convention and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and developing policy guidelines and campaigns against Protected Areas Downsizing, Downgrading & De-gazettement (PADDD).</p>

  <h3>Driving PCA management and governance excellence.</h3>
<p>This includes expanding the number of protected areas showing improvements in management effectiveness, based on assessment via the Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), CA|TS, or other regionally specific initiatives; promoting assessments of PCA governance; and assessing the feasibility and management of critical PCAs and Indigenous Reserves.</p>
 <h3>A groundbreaking initiative that adopts the Project Finance for Permanence (PFP) model</h3> 
<P>A unique financial approach in which governments make bold and ambitious long-term commitments to conservation, including fully funding the long-term management of the protected areas system. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Forest carbon projects that reduce the amount of GHG in the atmosphere, either by increasing forest carbon sequestration or by avoiding emissions, may produce carbon credits tradable in carbon offset markets. These credits are measured using a standardized unit of 1 metric ton of CO2 or its equivalent in other GHG. Activities such as afforestation, reforestation, avoided conversion, and improved forest management are the primary project types with methodologies approved by standard-setting bodies. Project developers are required to adhere to established guidelines and methodologies that ensure that any carbon credits generated represent additional and permanent carbon stored or sequestered—over and above what would occur in a business-as-usual scenario, or baseline. These project guidelines also establish landowner eligibility; ensure that buffer pools are set aside to protect against potential future carbon losses; and require monitoring, reporting, and verification. Because eligibility requirements can present a common obstacle for many landowners, some programs have taken steps to reduce high up-front costs and make forest carbon projects more accessible.</p>
 
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions – FAQs</h2>
  <h3>Q1
    What steps should be taken to conserve forests?</h3>
    <p>The forests can be conserved in the following manner:
      Introducing afforestation programs.
      Controlling forest fires.
      Proper utilization of forest resources.
      Proper care should be taken to protect the forests from pests and diseases.</p>

  <h3>Q2
    Why is it beneficial to conserve forests?</h3>
    <p>Forests provide us with a variety of resources such as wood, timber, fibre and other raw materials for domestic as well as commercial purposes. They absorb the harmful carbon dioxide gas and maintain the earth’s temperature. They also hold the soil firmly and prevent erosion of soil. This is why it is beneficial to conserve forests.</p>
  <h3>Q3
    How can we conserve wildlife?</h3>
    <p>Wildlife can be conserved by:
      Developing protective areas such as national parks, and wildlife sanctuaries to protect the animals in their natural habitat.
      The endangered and vulnerable species can be kept in captivity in places such as zoos and bred to increase their population.
      The cutting of forests should be strictly prohibited. It is an abode of a variety of wild animals.
      The hunting of wild animals should be banned.</p>
<h3>Q4
  What will happen if all the forests are destroyed?</h3>
  <p>Fossil fuels are a non-renewable source of energy. Most of the energy used by us is obtained by the burning of fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are used up at a faster rate. They cannot be regrown at a scale compared to their consumption.</p>
<h3>Q5
  What is Deforestation?</h3>
<p>Deforestation can be defined as the large-scale removal of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation of human activities. It is a serious environmental concern since it can result in the loss of biodiversity, damage to natural habitats.</p>
